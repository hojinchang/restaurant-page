# restaurant-page

## About
The purpose of this project is to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a restaurant homepage using JavaScript.

Furthermore, we will practice organizing the project into separate modules by using the Webpack module bundler. The Webpack module bundler takes various assets such as JavaScript files, CSS files, images, and other resouces, and bundles them together into a more efficient and optimized format for deployment.
